# ExpressJS -
It is the most famous, minimal and very flexible framework
of NodeJS which provides you with all you need to create
any modern and robust web application. In many ways, it is
similar to Flask but works with JavaScript.

# EJS -
It is an Embedded JavaScript Templating system used by
NodeJS. HTML is usually hardcoded, and cannot be
programmed but EJS enables it to have some logic added
into it. You may find the need to use loops or if-else
conditions in HTML while building a page, or the use of a
variable to display the userâ€™s name! EJS can enable you
with all those logic buildings in HTML

# Socket.io -
It is a JS library for socket programming, similar to the
socket library we were using in Python.

# UUID -
It is a JS library to create Unique IDs that can be used for
multiple things. In our case, we can give a unique ID to
different rooms on our video chat app, so that multiple video
chats can happen at once.

# PeerJS -
It is again, one of the most famous JS libraries that helps
communicating one client with the other, without the use of
a server. There are certain events like if another peer client
is on the same page as you, etc. that we may need and this
will help with just that, saving us to write a lot of code
ourselves.
